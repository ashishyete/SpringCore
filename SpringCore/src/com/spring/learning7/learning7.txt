Spring autowiring concept. 
Autowiring helps us in reducing some of the configurations while giving reference.

autowire="byName" -> this property will create referencing based on the property name defined.
for ex: if we have 3 beans named
bean1
bean2
bean3 all these beans have the same as type name in the class as
	private SampleBean bean1;
	private SampleBean bean2;
	private SampleBean bean3;
and all the beans are defined in the application-context.xml then autowire="byName" will automatically reference all beans.

	
autowire="byType" -> this property will create referencing based on the type.
for using this property a class should have one and only one distinct type, else the spring will not be able to guess the type and create ambiguity.
	
	
autowire="constructor" -> this property will create referencing based on the class's constructor defined.
for using this property a class should have one and only one distinct constructor, else the spring will not be able to guess the type and create ambiguity.
(same as autowire="byType")
